On dragging and dropping the xml files created in the last two activities, excel provides us with three ways in which
we can open our xml files:
 1. As an XML table
	-Since the XML source does not refer to a schema for activity 1 ,our xml file cannot be opened in Excel. Whereas 
	 for activity 2 the table data is displayed in Excel.
 2. As a read-only workbook
	-The XML files of activity 1 and 2 open in excel but their headings contain xml tag values with the backslash.
 3. Use the XML Source task pane
	-The XML files do not open in excel because the XML source does not refer to a schema
